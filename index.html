          Hi, I'm Stephanie. I am a self-taught UX/ UI designer and content writer based in Brooklyn, NY. My love of informed design stems from my experiences in digital marketing. Good design coupled with engaging content makes THE difference when running a digital marketing campaign of any kind. Happy, informed customers lead to marketers hitting business goals and objectives.

        <p>
          My goal as a designer is to craft useful structures that are both pleasing to the eye and enhance the overall user experience. I enjoy the problem solving process and collaborating with team members to refine designs. 
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p>
          As a content creator, I'm heavily invested in thorough research before putting pen to paper, in order to write, edit, and develop creative with clarity and authority on a variety of topics. 
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p>
          I have a diverse background with my B.S. in Biochemistry and experience working in multiple channels of digital marketing.  Currently, I'm sharpening my design and writing skills at a marketing agency in Manhattan and freelancing. In my free time, I explore different painting techniques and write short stories - check out some of my illustrations <a class="illustration-link" href="illustrations.html">here</a>!
